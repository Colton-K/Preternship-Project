# Name

`MPI_File_read_ordered_end` - Reads a file at a location specified by
a shared file pointer; ending part of a split collective routine
(blocking).

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_File_read_ordered_end(MPI_File fh, void *buf,

    MPI_Status *status)
```

## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_FILE_READ_ORDERED_END(FH, BUF, STATUS, IERROR)
    <type>    BUF(*)

    INTEGER    FH, STATUS(MPI_STATUS_SIZE), IERROR
```

## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_File_read_ordered_end(fh, buf, status, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_File), INTENT(IN) :: fh
    TYPE(*), DIMENSION(..), ASYNCHRONOUS :: buf
    TYPE(MPI_Status) :: status
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input/Output Parameter

* `fh` : File handle (handle).

# Output Parameters

* `buf` : Initial address of buffer (choice).
* `status` : Status object (status).
* `IERROR` : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

`MPI_File_read_ordered_end` is the ending part of a split collective
routine that must be called by all processes in the communicator group
associated with the file handle `fh`. `MPI_File_rad_ordered_end` blocks
until the operation initiated by `MPI_File_read_ordered_begin` completes.
It attempts to read the file associated with `fh` into the user's
buffer `buf`. The shared file pointer is updated by the amounts of data
requested by all processes of the group. For each process, the location
in the file at which data is read is the position at which the shared
file pointer would be after all processes whose ranks within the group
are less than that of this process had read their data.

# Notes

All the nonblocking collective routines for data access are "split"
into two routines, each with `_begin` or `_end` as a suffix. These split
collective routines are subject to the semantic rules described in
Section 9.4.5 of the MPI-2 standard.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. For MPI I/O function errors, the default error handler is set to
`MPI_ERRORS_RETURN`. The error handler may be changed with
`MPI_File_set_errhandler`; the predefined error handler
`MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL` may be used to make I/O errors fatal. Note that MPI
does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
