# Name

`MPI_File_write_ordered_begin` - Writes a file at a location specified
by a shared file pointer; beginning part of a split collective routine
(nonblocking).

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_File_write_ordered_begin(MPI_File fh, const void *buf,

    int count, MPI_Datatype datatype)
```

## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_FILE_WRITE_ORDERED_BEGIN(FH, BUF, COUNT, DATATYPE, IERROR)
    <type>    BUF(*)
    INTEGER    FH, COUNT, DATATYPE, IERROR
```

## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_File_write_ordered_begin(fh, buf, count, datatype, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_File), INTENT(IN) :: fh
    TYPE(*), DIMENSION(..), INTENT(IN), ASYNCHRONOUS :: buf
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: count
    TYPE(MPI_Datatype), INTENT(IN) :: datatype
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input/Output Parameter

* `fh` : File handle (handle).

# Input Parameters

* `buf` : Initial address of buffer (choice).
* `count` : Number of elements in buffer (integer).
* `datatype` : Data type of each buffer element (handle).

# Output Parameter

* `IERROR` : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

`MPI_File_write_ordered_begin` is the beginning part of a split
collective, nonblocking routine that must be called by all processes in
the communicator group associated with the file handle `fh`. Each
process may pass different argument values for the `datatype` and
`count` arguments. After all processes of the group have issued their
respective calls, each process attempts to write, into the file
associated with `fh`, a total number of `count` data items having
datatype type contained in the user's buffer `buf`. For each process,
the location in the file at which data is written is the position at
which the shared file pointer would be after all processes whose ranks
within the group are less than that of this process had written their
data.

# Notes

All the nonblocking collective routines for data access are "split"
into two routines, each with `_begin` or `_end` as a suffix. These split
collective routines are subject to the semantic rules described in
Section 9.4.5 of the MPI-2 standard.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. For MPI I/O function errors, the default error handler is set to
`MPI_ERRORS_RETURN`. The error handler may be changed with
`MPI_File_set_errhandler`; the predefined error handler
`MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL` may be used to make I/O errors fatal. Note that MPI
does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
