# Name

MPI_Get_processor_name  - Gets the name of the processor.

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Get_processor_name(char *name, int *resultlen)
```

## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_GET_PROCESSOR_NAME(NAME, RESULTLEN, IERROR)
    CHARACTER*(*)    NAME
    INTEGER        RESULTLEN, IERROR 
```

## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Get_processor_name(name, resultlen, ierror)
    CHARACTER(LEN=MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME), INTENT(OUT) :: name
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: resultlen
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Output Parameters

* `name` : A unique specifier for the actual (as opposed to virtual) node.
* `resultlen` : Length (in characters) of result returned in name.
* `IERROR` : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

# Description

This routine returns the `name` of the processor on which it was called at
the moment of the call. The `name` is a character string for maximum
flexibility. From this value it must be possible to identify a specific
piece of hardware. The argument `name` must represent storage that is at
least `MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME` characters long.
The number of characters actually written is returned in the output
argument, resultlen.

# Notes

The user must provide at least `MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME` space to write the
processor name; processor names can be this long. The user should
examine the output argument, resultlen, to determine the actual length
of the name.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
`MPI_Comm_set_errhandler`; the predefined error handler `MPI_ERRORS_RETURN`
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
