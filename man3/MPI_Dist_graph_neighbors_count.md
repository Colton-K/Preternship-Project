# Name

MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors_count  - Returns the number of in and out
edges for the calling processes in a distributed graph topology and a
flag indicating whether the distributed graph is weighted.

# Syntax

## C Syntax

```c
#include <mpi.h>

int MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors_count(MPI_Comm comm, int *indegree,
    int *outdegree, int *weighted)
```

## Fortran Syntax

```fortran
USE MPI
! or the older form: INCLUDE 'mpif.h'

MPI_DIST_GRAPH_NEIGHBORS_COUNT(COMM, INDEGREE, OUTDEGREE, WEIGHTED, IERROR)
    INTEGER    COMM, INDEGREE, OUTDEGREE, IERROR
        LOGICAL WEIGHTED
```

## Fortran 2008 Syntax

```fortran
USE mpi_f08

MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors_count(comm, indegree, outdegree, weighted, ierror)
    TYPE(MPI_Comm), INTENT(IN) :: comm
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: indegree, outdegree
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: weighted
    INTEGER, OPTIONAL, INTENT(OUT) :: ierror
```


# Input Parameters

* `comm` : Communicator with distributed graph topology (handle).

# Output Parameters

* `indegree` : Number of edges into this process (non-negative integer).
* `outdegree` : Number of edges out of this process (non-negative integer).
* `weighted` : False if MPI_UNWEIGHTED was supplied during creation, true otherwise
(logical).
* `IERROR` : Fortran only: Error status (integer).
```


# Description

`MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors_count` and `MPI_Graph_neighbors` provide adjacency
information for a distributed graph topology.
`MPI_Dist_graph_neighbors_count` returns the number of sources and
destinations for the calling process.

# Errors

Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the value
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called. By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for
I/O function errors. The error handler may be changed with
`MPI_Comm_set_errhandler`; the predefined error handler `MPI_ERRORS_RETURN`
may be used to cause error values to be returned. Note that MPI does not
guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.
